# CodeQuiz_Challenge4

This application is a timed and interactive quiz on coding fundamentals using JavaScript. The user has 75 seconds to complete the quiz, starting when they click the 'Start Quiz' button. The user's final score will be the time left on the clock. This multiple choice quiz will deduct 10 seconds (points) per question answered incorrectly. If the time runs out, a 'All Done!' page will emerge with a score of 0, allowing them to still save their score and initials. If the quiz is finished under the allotted time, they are taken to a different page where they can save their score and initials. Once the user enters their initials with their respective score, a different page emerges showing their last saved score (typically their highest score yet) with a button that allows them to clear their score and click a separate button to return to the home page and restart the quiz again. The user may take the quiz as many times as they like until satisfied with their final score.
